## Setup
A [Replicate](url) account is required. Replicate offers endpoints for community AI models. The model used here costs about $.04 (USD) per run.

Two cameras are required. If you have an updated iPhone, you can use the Continuity Camera feature and openCV will read it. 

Bright lighting and a clean surface will get you higher quality generations.

## Running the program
TBD
